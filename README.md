(Post hoc repo creation)
Very unfurnished (and erroneous) frontend, but this accepts a stock ticker, a time interval (each trading data bar length), and then a call option strike and expiry. It displays a price chart, premium for said contract, and the greeks.

This uses a locally hosted backend for the actual pricing methods, run the main app program after following the backend instructions (fastapi-options repo).
